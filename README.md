# DVIR-Pipeline-Tech-Talk

This repository contains all the samples for the DVIR tech talk regarding the
basics of a pipeline and what is CI / CD.

Code in this repository is written using [Deno](https://deno.land/) since
Typescript is a bit simpler to understand than goLang, C# or Kotlin.

## What is a pipeline

1. Verify that your code matches the desired standards
2. Compile / build your code
3. Automatically test your code
4. Deploy your code somewhere
